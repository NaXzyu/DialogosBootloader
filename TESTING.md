# Testing Guidelines for DialogosBootloader

Welcome to the testing documentation for DialogosBootloader. This guide outlines our testing philosophy, the types of tests we use, and instructions for running tests.

## Testing Philosophy

Our goal is to create a robust and reliable operating system. To achieve this, we rely on a comprehensive suite of tests that cover various aspects of the system. We believe in the power of automated testing to identify issues early, often, and reliably.

## Types of Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Validate the functionality of individual components in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Ensure that different parts of the system work together as expected.
- **System Tests**: Test the system's behavior as a whole.
- **Performance Tests**: Assess the system's performance under various conditions.

## Running Tests

To run the tests, navigate to the root directory of the project and execute the following command:

```bash
scripts/test.sh
```

This script will run all the automated tests and output the results.

## Adding New Tests

When contributing new features or fixes, please add corresponding tests. This helps us maintain the quality and stability of the system.

## Reporting Test Failures

If you encounter any test failures, please open an issue on GitHub with the following information:
- A clear description of the problem
- The steps to reproduce the issue
- The expected and actual results

## Continuous Integration

We use continuous integration (CI) to automatically run tests on every commit. This ensures that changes do not break existing functionality.

Thank you for helping us test DialogosBootloader. Your contributions are invaluable to the project's success.
