# Roadmap for DialogosBootloader

## Vision
Our vision is to create a groundbreaking operating system (OS) that not only functions with high efficiency but also possesses the ability to understand and improve upon its own codebase. With an embedded large language model (LLM), DialogosBootloader will be the foundation of an OS that learns, adapts, and enhances itself recursively. This self-improving system will be capable of networking into grids of host nodes, forming a robust and intelligent OS ecosystem.

## Long-Term Goals
- **Year 1-2**: Establish a solid foundation for the OS with basic functionality and a stable bootloader.
- **Year 3**: Integrate the LLM and develop the OS's capability to learn from its environment and code.
- **Year 4**: Implement networking capabilities, allowing multiple instances of the OS to communicate and share resources.
- **Year 5 and Beyond**: Achieve a self-improving system that can train on its own code and user interactions, continuously enhancing its performance and capabilities.

## Milestones
